Below, I'll provide more depth on some steps and essential highlights to ensure everything is covered.\n\n### Detailed Instructions:\n\n1. **Open Project Folder in VSCode**:\n   - First, navigate to your project directory in the terminal:\n     ```sh\n     cd path/to/project-folder\n     ```\n   - Open VSCode in that directory:\n     ```sh\n     code .\n     ```\n\n2. **Install Node Modules**:\n   - Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 20+).\n   - In the terminal within VSCode, run:\n     ```sh\n     npm init -y\n     npm install express multer node-fetch\n     ```\n\n3. **Update `package.json`**:\n   - Your `package.json` should now have the necessary dependencies and script configurations.\n\n4. **Launch Configuration in VSCode**:\n   - Ensure you have the `launch.json` file setup in the `.vscode` folder.\n   - This configuration allows you to debug the server by pressing `F5` and selecting the \"Launch Server\" configuration.\n\n5. **Serve Static Files and Start Server**:\n   - Use the `npm start` script or the VSCode debugger to start your server.\n     ```sh\n     npm start\n     ```\n\n6. **Use Live Server for Client**:\n   - Install the \"Live Server\" extension in VSCode to serve your `client/index.html`.\n   - Right-click on `index.html` and select \"Open with Live Server‚Äù.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- **Security**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is securely handled and not exposed in the client-side code.\n- **File Handling**: Monitor and manage the `uploads` directory to handle temporary files appropriately.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement error checks and handling both in your server and client scripts.\n\nBy confirming each part of the setup and code functions correctly, you should have a fully operational application ready for further expansion and testing.
