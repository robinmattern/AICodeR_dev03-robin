You're correct, and thank you for your attention to detail! The original response did not provide a full example of how to use `lit` library with Web Components (Lit Elements). Here's the corrected code:

Firstly, ensure that you have installed `@lit/reactive-element`, which is part of Lit. You can do this via NPM:

```sh
npm install @lit/reactive-element --save-dev
```

In your main JS file (`index.js`):

```javascript
import { html } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/lit/dist@2/core/lit-core.min.js';
import { LitElement, customElement, property } from '@lit/reactive-element';

// Login Form Component definition
class LoginForm extends LitElement {
    static get properties() {
        return {
            username: String,
            password: String,
            errorMessage: String,
        };
    }

    constructor() {
        super();
        this.username = '';
        this.password = '';
        this.errorMessage = null;
    }

    async validateForm(event) {
        event.preventDefault();

        const usernameRegex = /^[a-zA-Z]+$/;

        if (!this.username.match(usernameRegex)) {
            this.errorMessage = 'Username must contain only letters.';
            return false;
        } else {
            this.errorMessage = null;  // Clear error message
            console.log('Form is valid');
        }

        return true;
    }
}

// Registering the component
customElements.define('login-form', LoginForm);
```

You need to import `html`, `LitElement` and `customElement` from the Lit library, as well as `property` if you want dynamic properties.

Then in your HTML file:

```html
<script type="module">
    // Your imports here like `<script src="index.js"></script>`

    <login-form></login-form>
</script>

<!-- HTML for the form -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

<body>
    <!-- Other content here -->
</body>
```

This example demonstrates how to create a `LitElement` component, which you can then use in your web application. This is done by defining the component's properties (`username`, `password`, and `errorMessage`) along with its behavior (`validateForm`). After creating this class, `customElements.define()` method registers it as an HTML element.

The `<login-form>` tag would then be used in your HTML like any other HTML tag for a login form. 

Remember that `LitElement` instances have a `.state` property where you can manage the component's state and use the reactive features of Lit, which is very useful for more complex applications with dynamic content or interactions.

Finally, I'd recommend following best practices for web components such as including proper ARIA roles/properties, error handling, and ensuring accessibility (e.g., by adding `title` attributes to inputs and ensuring there's keyboard focus management). This code is a basic example for illustration purposes.
